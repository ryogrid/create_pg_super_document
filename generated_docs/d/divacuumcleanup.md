# divacuumcleanup

## Location
[src/test/modules/dummy_index_am/dummy_index_am.c:194-203](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/tree/92268b35d04c2de416279f187d12f264afa22614/src/test/modules/dummy_index_am/dummy_index_am.c#L194-L203)

## Overview
A stub implementation of post-VACUUM cleanup for the dummy index access method used in PostgreSQL testing. This function provides the cleanup interface but performs no actual operations.

## Definition

```c
static IndexBulkDeleteResult *
divacuumcleanup(IndexVacuumInfo *info, IndexBulkDeleteResult *stats)
```
## Detailed Description
The  function is a minimal implementation of the vacuum cleanup interface for the dummy index access method. This function is called after bulk delete operations during VACUUM to perform any final cleanup tasks and return statistics about the vacuum operation.

Since the dummy index AM doesn't actually maintain any index data structures, this function simply returns NULL, indicating that no statistics are available and no cleanup operations were performed. This is the expected behavior for a test framework component that simulates index operations without actual functionality.
